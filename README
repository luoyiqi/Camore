	This is an android project(android studio) aiming to generate a super-resolution image from multiple 
low-resolution images.Renderscipt is used to realize parallel computation. The very heart of this project lies 
in the computation core which consists of three principal components ,ie,image registeration,motion 
estimate and image fusion. During the generation of the super-resolution image, low resolution images are 
splitted into multiple blocks due to the variation of translation in the the source image. Then the splitted 
blocks are iterated and the data in each block is processed separately.Currently the quality of generated 
super-resolution image is not quite satisfying, the dilema is primarily about accelerating image 
registration with high accuracy.
